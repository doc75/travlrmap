### Introduction

I've travaled a lot and kept track of the places I've been.  I wanted to store this data and be able to display it but all online tools I've used for this purpose have either held my data hostage or gone out of business.

I set out to create a simple site that keeps my travels in YAML files without any databases or hard to manage dependencies.  You can manage it completely using just Git, a text editor and a free account at Heroku.

Your data is in a simple to parse YAML format and the site provides end points to convert it to JSON or industry standard [KML](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language).

My own travels built using this software can be seen [here](http://travels.devco.net/).
